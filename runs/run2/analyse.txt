Scenario 2: Balanced Style and Content

Configuration:
Style Layers: ['conv1_1', 'conv2_1', 'conv3_1', 'conv4_1'] (a mix of low- to high-level layers to capture both textures and broader structures).
Content Layers: ['conv4_1'] (higher-level features reflecting the overall structure of the content image).
Style Weights: [1, 1, 1, 1] (equal importance across all style layers).
TV Weight: 1e-4 (moderate smoothing effect).

Effect on Output:
Balances the preservation of content structure and incorporation of style elements.
The use of higher-level style layers (conv4_1) adds structure-related style elements, while lower layers (conv1_1) retain texture.
Moderate TV weight helps maintain smooth transitions in the output, reducing noise while preserving detail.

Insights:
Ideal for general stylization tasks where both the content and style need to be harmonized without overly favoring one.
Equal weights across style layers ensure no single type of feature dominates, creating a well-rounded result.
