Scenario 3: Artistic Stylization

Configuration:
Style Layers: ['conv4_1', 'conv5_1'] (focus on capturing higher-level artistic patterns).
Content Layers: ['conv4_1'] (emphasizes mid-to-high-level structure in the content image).
Style Weights: [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5] (progressively increasing weights, emphasizing more abstract features).
TV Weight: 1e-3 (higher smoothing effect for more cohesive output).

Effect on Output:
Produces stylized outputs with more abstract, painterly effects by emphasizing higher-level style layers.
Less focus on fine textures; instead, broader artistic patterns dominate.
The higher TV weight ensures smooth transitions, resulting in a more cohesive and less noisy image.

Insights:
Suitable for creating artistic renditions where the styleâ€™s abstract and structural aspects take precedence over precise texture reproduction.
Progressive style weights can enhance specific features, allowing for flexible emphasis on different aspects of the style.
