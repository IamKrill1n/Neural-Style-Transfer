# Neural-Style-Transfer
# To-do List

## Experiment with Hyperparameters in the Original Method
- Change the layers and layers' weights and observe the effects.
- Adjust the content/style weights (alpha/beta), and experiment with Patch-based Style loss.
- Modify the initialization, for example:
    - White noise
    - Content image
    - Blurred content image
    - Partially stylized image
